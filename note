 we are only translating the english to odia translation now when i click the desia to english or desia to odia it should give me an out put now how will i train the desia to english dont do any change in my code
i have chatgpt api key for desia now use the api to get the desia to english , english to desia , odia to desia , desia to odia translation
use the openai api key in the backend to translate odia to desia and vice versa and english to desia and vice versa
ଏବେ ଅନା ପର୍କା ମନ୍‌ ନା-ଚଲେ

now my goal is to convert the generated odia sentence to desia. my plan is to make odia as a bridge language for converison since we cant directly translate english to desia or vice versa. but odia to desia and vice versa can be done since i have a dictionary where it contains, desia words, odia words, desia sentences.

also i have a file where category,desia words, odia words are there.(category reprsents the alphabets or the parts of the speech).

so what we can do is we will look the odia words in dictionary, and find its alternate desia word then apply some algorithm and whatever the process is to make a proper desia sentence.
